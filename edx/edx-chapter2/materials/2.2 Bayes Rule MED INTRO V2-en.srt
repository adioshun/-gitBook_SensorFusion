1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,870
In this video, we are going to introduce

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,120
one of the more important tools that

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,370
is needed to do Bayesian inference,

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,290
and that is Bayes' rule.

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,870
Additionally, we will show how we can apply it

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,510
in a simple toy example involving picking fruits

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,620
from an urn.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,830
If you remember the three steps involved in a Bayesian method

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,020
that we discussed in the previous video,

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,270
this would relate to the second step--

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,810
the measurement update.

12
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,550
Here is our toy example, where we're

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,090
going to select a fruit from one of these urns.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,160
We start by selecting from which urn we are

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,930
going to pick our fruit from--

16
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,060
either the blue urn or the red one--

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,160
and we do so with equal probability.

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,820
It's a 50% chance we'll pick the red one and a 50% chance

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,200
that we'll pick the blue one.

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,450
From whichever urn that we choose,

21
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,520
we pick a fruit without looking.

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,470
Simple enough, right?

23
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,240
The question that we would like to answer,

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,730
using Bayesian statistics, is that,

25
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,970
if we picked an orange, what is the probability that we

26
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,670
chose the red urn to pick from?

27
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,890
To answer this question, we should first

28
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,010
go through some Bayesian statistics.

29
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,170
Bayesian statistics is simple.

30
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,860
We only need two rules.

31
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,580
The first is called conditional probability,

32
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,170
or, the product rule.

33
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,590
It states that we can always decompose the joint probability

34
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,820
of two random variables as a product with two factors.

35
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,570
In this case, we have two random variables, y and theta.

36
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,330
The product rule then states that we can always

37
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,720
factorize this joint probability as the conditional probability

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,800
of y given theta, times the probability of theta.

39
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,630
Note that the order here does not matter,

40
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,120
and we can always factorize it in the other way around.

41
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,630


42
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,820
We can factorize it as the probability of theta given y,

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,440
times the probability of y.

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,840


45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,320
The second rule is called the law of total probability,

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,750
or the sum rule, which states that we

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,820
can find the marginal distribution

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,300
of a random variable by summing the joint probability

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,150
over all possible outcomes of the random variable

50
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,280
that we're not interested in.

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,950
In this case here, we're interested in probability mass

52
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,530
function of a discrete random variable, y,

53
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,960
which you can find from the joint probability of y

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,020
and theta by summing this joint probability

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,600
over all possible values of theta.

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,270
This is also called marginalizing our theta,

57
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,330
as we are essentially removing the influence of theta

58
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,870
from the joint, to get a marginal distribution of just

59
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,950
y.

60
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,470
For continuous random variables, the summation

61
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,900
is exchanged with integration, but the concept

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,400
is all the same.

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,370
Bayes' rule, which we will be using extensively

64
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,790
in this course, is basically a consequence

65
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,950
of conditional probability.

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,620
Remember that conditional probability

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,430
allowed us to decompose the joint probability of y

68
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,070
and theta in two ways--

69
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,420
either as the probability of y given

70
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,810
theta, times the probability of theta, or the other way around.

71
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,530
As both of these express the same joint probability,

72
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,240
there must be an equal sign here.

73
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,920
If we consider this equality and divide both sides by p of y,

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,680
we basically get Bayes' rule.

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,310
Bayes' rule states that p of theta given y

76
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,270
can be written as p of y given theta, times p

77
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,730
of theta, divided by p of y.

78
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,470
Note that this gives us the ability

79
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,050
to switch conditional probabilities, in that we can

80
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,870
express the conditional probability of theta given

81
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,540
y in terms of the probability of y

82
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,020
given theta and some other factors here which are usually

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,520
fairly simple.

84
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,130
This is the main usage of Bayes' rule.

85
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,010
It allows us to express a relation of interest,

86
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,910
p of theta given y, so the probability of the quantity

87
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,360
of interest, theta, given our observation-- which, in our toy

88
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,570
example would be the probability that we have chosen

89
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,840
a particular urn, given that we observed

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,800
that we have picked an orange.

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,170
We can express this in terms of a relation that we know,

92
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,110
which is p of y given theta.

93
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,510
In our toy example, being the probability

94
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,580
of picking a certain fruit, given

95
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,279
that we know which urn we pick from,

96
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,430
we should also note that the factor in our denominator,

97
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,000
p of y, can be found using the law of total probability

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,110
like this.

99
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,040
Express it in terms of these factors here.

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,740
Let's use this to solve our toy example.

101
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,450
We let theta be the quantity of interest--

102
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,140
which in this case is the color of the urn that we picked

103
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,160
our fruit from--

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,250
where r indicates that we picked from a red run

105
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,160
and b that we picked from the blue.

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,550
Further, we let y be our observation, which in this case

107
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,440
is which fruit we picked--

108
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,860
o as an orange and a for an apple.

109
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,260
If we remember, the question is, if we

110
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,180
know that we picked an orange--

111
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,770
so, y equals to o--

112
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,140
what is the probability that we picked

113
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,840
the orange from the red urn--

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,540
which in this notation would mean that theta equals r.

115
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,790
If we express this mathematically,

116
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,090
we would like to calculate the conditional probability

117
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,400
that theta equals r, given that y equals o,

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,590
which we write like this.

119
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:36,960
Probability of theta equals r, given that y equals o.

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,810


121
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,060
We are not able to calculate this probability directly

122
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,580
from what we know, however, without making

123
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,810
any observations we know that there is a 50% chance

124
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,890
that we have chosen the red urn.

125
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,350
The probability of theta being r is equal to one half.

126
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,500
Also, if we know that we picked the fruit from the red urn,

127
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,560
we can calculate the probability of picking orange,

128
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
as we see that there are six oranges in the red urn and two

129
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,390
apples.

130
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,450
The probability of picking an orange from the red urn

131
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,870
would be 6/8, or 3/4.

132
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,120
Mathematically, we would write this as probability of y

133
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,810
being equal to orange, condition on we picked from the red urn,

134
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,990
and this is 3/4.

135
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,650
How can we use this to express the probability

136
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,250
that we're interested in?

137
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,600
Well, if we use Bayes' rule, we can reverse the conditioning

138
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,230
here so that we get a term where these two factors have switched

139
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,950
places, which is exactly what we have right here.

140
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,180
Let's try this out.

141
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,770
Using Bayes' rule, we get--

142
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:55,730


143
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,950
So, we see that we get this factor here,

144
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,560
which is the probability that we pick

145
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,300
an orange if we know that we choose from the red urn--

146
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,640
which we know to be 3/4--

147
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,620
and this factor, which is the probability

148
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,050
that we have chosen the red urn without making

149
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,400
any observations.

150
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,590
This is one half, and then we get this factor here,

151
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,970
which is a marginal probability of choosing an orange.

152
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,580
We know this one, we know this one--

153
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,410
how can we calculate this one?

154
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,030
We can use one of the rules that we

155
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,910
know, the law of total probability, which

156
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,780
states that the marginal p of y equal to orange--

157
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,450
the marginal probability that we pick an orange--

158
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,780
is the probability of picking orange from the red urn, which

159
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,850
is expressed by the joint probability,

160
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,970
plus the joint probability that we have picked

161
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,170
an orange from the blue urn.

162
00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:01,680


163
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,710
Now we can calculate these using the product rule, which

164
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,340
means that we decompose these into two factors which

165
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,610
are similar to the decomposition here.

166
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,280
For the first, we get the probability

167
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,060
of picking an orange--

168
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,860
given that we're picking from the red urn, which is 3/4--

169
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,370
times the probability that we're picking from a red urn, which

170
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,060
is one half.

171
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,730


172
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,810
Similarly, for the second term, we

173
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,990
get the probability of picking an orange, given that we

174
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,659
are picking from the blue urn--

175
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,299
as in the blue urn, there are only one orange

176
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,710
and four fruits in total--

177
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,340
times the probability of picking the red urn, which is one half,

178
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,210
again.

179
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,252
If we sum this up we see that this becomes one half.

180
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:51,960
When you put it all together to calculate

181
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,290
the probability that we have chosen the red urn--

182
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,910
given that we observe that we pick an orange--

183
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,970
we see that this is the probability

184
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,700
of picking an orange from the red urn, which

185
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,020
is 3/4, times the probability that we are picking

186
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,980
from the blue urn, which is one half, divided

187
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,490
by the marginal probability that we are picking an orange,

188
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,360
which we have calculated using the law of total probability

189
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,450
and conditional probability, to be one half.

190
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,120
If we solve this, we see that these cancel out

191
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,760
and we get the probability to 3/4.

192
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,090
The probability that we picked a fruit from the red urn,

193
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,330
given that we picked an orange, is 3/4.

194
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,750
We use Bayes' rule to calculate the conditional probability

195
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,420
using terms that we could more easily calculate,

196
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,290
or express, using conditional probability and the law

197
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,860
of total probability.

198
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,648
