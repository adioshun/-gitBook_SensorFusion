1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,040
Throughout this course, we will formulate our filtering

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,880
prediction and smoothing problems using so-called state

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,470
space models.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,650
We will use these statistical models to describe

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,150
what we're interested in--

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,040
we call this our state vector--

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,800
how the state vector evolves over time,

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,370
and how it relates to the observations that we make.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,380
We will in a later lecture show how

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,490
we can use these models to solve the general filtering problem.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,630
So in this lecture, we will look at how we define these models,

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,810
and what's their purpose when it comes to solving our estimation

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,100
problems.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,550
We will focus our attention on discrete time state space

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,820
models, as it's often enough to estimate our state

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,570
with a certain time interval.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,250
So discrete time state space model models a so-called state

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,190
vector, which we denote xk and a measurement vector,

19
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,680
which we denote yk where k here is a discrete time

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,390
index, in both cases.

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,970
First, we have a motion or process model,

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,360
which in its most general form describes the current state,

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,980
xk, as a function, fk minus 1, of the previous state,

24
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,750
xk minus 1, and a motion noise process, qk minus 1.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,800
The purpose of this model is to statistically describe how

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,030
the state evolves over time.

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,470
Secondly, we have a measurement or a sensor model,

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,780
which, again, in this most general form,

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,810
describes the current measurement yk

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,120
as a function hk of the current state, xk, and a measurement

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,890
noise process, rk.

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,040
The purpose here is to statistically describe

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,990
how we can relate the current state to our observation, yk.

34
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,540
Additionally, in our discrete time state space model,

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,000
we also have a prior distribution of our state.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,420
This is the distribution of our state at time 0

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,640
before we make any observation.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,460
With this model, we can describe any general knowledge

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,320
that we have about our state vector

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,750
before we even make any observations.

41
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,620
So these are the basic building blocks of a discrete time state

42
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,840
space model, and I'm sure that you

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,900
have come across this type of model in other courses

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,690
that you have studied, for example, in control theory.

45
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,580
What we typically also assume, which

46
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,680
is not evident from what we see here,

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,060
is that both the motion noise, qk minus 1,

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,900
and the measurement noise, rk, are

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,085
independent of all other noise vectors.

50
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:28,460
This means that they are not only

51
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,450
independent from each other but also independent over time.

52
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,670
So the measurement noise at time k

53
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,770
is independent from the measurement noise

54
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,210
at time k minus 1, for example.

55
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,240
And these assumptions also ensures

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,780
that the Markov property holds for the state space model.

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,590
All right, so let's look into more detail regarding

58
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,570
the motion and measurement models.

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,080
We start with a motion or process model.

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,090
I should mention that, throughout the course,

61
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,210
I will probably use both of these terms interchangeably.

62
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,330
The term process model stems from control theory

63
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,720
where one, in general, wants to control some process.

64
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,910
And then one needs a model for the dynamics

65
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,450
of this process, which is then called a process model.

66
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,180
In terms of, for example, estimating the position

67
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,760
of a vehicle, the process model, in this case,

68
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,430
should then describe the dynamics of the vehicle,

69
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,260
and thus the process model will describe

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,140
the motion of the vehicle.

71
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,950
The more descriptive name, in this case,

72
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,860
is to call the process model for what it is,

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,200
and that's a motion model.

74
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,420
So in sum, the system dynamics is described by this model

75
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,805
here, which we refer to as a motion or a process model.

76
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,180
There are a couple of things that

77
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,160
are interesting to note here.

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,790
Firstly, the motion model describes the state evolution,

79
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,010
and an equivalent view of this is

80
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,050
that it describes the distribution

81
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,950
of the current state condition on the previous state.

82
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,290
Often, when we talk about the motion model,

83
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,290
we have both of these representations in mind--

84
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,860
both the equation form here and the density form here.

85
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,320
They are equivalent views of the motion or process model.

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,500


87
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:19,060
With this interpretation here, we

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,579
assume that we have perfect knowledge about where the state

89
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,220
was one time instance ago.

90
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,520
That is, we have no uncertainty about this.

91
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,230
What the motion model then describes

92
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,770
is the distribution of xk conditioned

93
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,420
on the previous state.

94
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,530
So what are probable states in the next time instance?

95
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,910
As such, the motion model allows us to connect states over time

96
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,110
and help us rule out unreasonable trajectories.

97
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,320
That is if we want to estimate the position of an object

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,830
over time we typically have physical constraints that

99
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,170
limits the movements of this object over time

100
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,171


101
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,200
So if we assume that we are tracking, the motion of some

102
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
object over time.

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,560
We often want this trajectory to look fairly smooth

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,190
due to physical constraints.

105
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,520
Often, something like this, and not something like this.

106
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,940


107
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,690
And we use the motion model to rule out these unreasonable

108
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,740
trajectories.

109
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,340
So let us look at this from the perspective of an example.

110
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,110
So if the state at time k minus 1, for example,

111
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,470
describes the position and velocity of a vehicle.

112
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,950
So it describes the position and velocity of this vehicle.

113
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,110
So knowing this, the aim of the motion model

114
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,480
is to describe the state at time k

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,060
or the distribution of the state at time k.

116
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,280
In this case, it seems reasonable to assume

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,320
that the vehicle continues to move

118
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,370
as it did at time k minus 1, which would give us

119
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,829
a state something like this.

120
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,370
However, we cannot rule out that the vehicle doesn't make any

121
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,200
changes to its velocity vector by, for example,

122
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,740
turning the steering wheel, stepping on the brake,

123
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,720
or pushing the accelerator pedal.

124
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,660
This would mean that we need to allow for the predictions

125
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,070
to look something like this.

126
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,970
If for example, the vehicle has turned somewhat.

127
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,460
But we still need these deviations

128
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,960
to be reasonable and not as we see in this example here.

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,200
So it's unreasonable that a vehicle which

130
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,630
has a velocity like this would, in a short time instance,

131
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,270
have a position and velocity like this.

132
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,120
And this is unreasonable both form a vehicle dynamics

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,430
perspective and also from the kind of changes

134
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,660
that one can expect the driver to make.

135
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,500
So the motion model considers two aspects.

136
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,930
The dynamics of the system, which is usually

137
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,470
described using physical models and the uncertainty

138
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,950
regarding what can change between two time instances.

139
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,850
And how much changes we allow is modeled by the motion noise

140
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,410
process, qk minus 1.

141
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,260
These two aspects together make up all statistical model

142
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,440
probable state at the current time, given the state

143
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,060
at the previous time instance.

144
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,230
And in this case, we could get some distribution

145
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,490
looking like this.

146
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,710


147
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,040
So states in this region are probable.

148
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,430
States outside this region are improbable.

149
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,100
And this is an illustration of the motion model.

150
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,680


151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,100
And with this motion model, these types of states

152
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,110
here would be very improbable.

153
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,000
The other piece of the puzzle is what's

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,620
called the measurement model, which

155
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,660
describe how the measurement relates

156
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,480
to the state vector using this equation here.

157
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,550
Also in this case, we have two names

158
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,960
that we use interchangeably.

159
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,930
We call it the measurement model or the sensor model.

160
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,210
We should note that, as with the motion model,

161
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,910
the measurement model has an equivalent probabilistic

162
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,110
interpretation as it describes the distribution of yk

163
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,600
given our state, xk, so p of yk given xk.

164
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,440
And we recognize this distribution

165
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,266
here as our likelihood function.

166
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,640
So the measurement model actually

167
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,420
defines the likelihood function in our estimation problem.

168
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,700
As such, when we talk about the measurement model,

169
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,730
we sometimes mean the likelihood function,

170
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:02,060
as they are equivalent.

171
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,520
As with the motion model, we have

172
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,000
an equivalent probabilistic representation

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,350
of this equation.

174
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,820
The other thing that we should note

175
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,210
is that we use the measurement model to relate data

176
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,130
to our state vector, and it helps

177
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,920
us to use data to learn more about our states.

178
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,080
And in most cases, we cannot observe the state directly.

179
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,260
And even if it could, our measurements

180
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:15,929
are then corrupted by measurement noise.

181
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,000
So let us look at this from an example

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,679
where we have a host vehicle that

183
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,130
is equipped with some sensor.

184
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,309
Let's say a radar in front of the vehicle, which

185
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,530
has this field of view here.

186
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,860
This radar will give us noisy observations of this vehicle

187
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,310
here that we are interested in positioning.

188
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,650
So in this case, our state vector, xk,

189
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,170
represents the position of this vehicle,

190
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,810
and yk then represents the radar returns

191
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,520
that we get from this vehicle.

192
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,060
One way to view this measurement model here, or here,

193
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,810
is to view it as a generative model that we, in this case,

194
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,930
can use to simulate radar returns, from this vehicle

195
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,440
here.

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,090
If we design our measurement model,

197
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,790
hk, accurately, we should then be

198
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,850
able to simulate radar returns from the vehicle, which

199
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,040
both describes where on the vehicle

200
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,960
we expect the radar returns to end up

201
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,470
as well as the statistical fluctuations in the returns,

202
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,040
which are influenced by our measurement noise process, rk.

203
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,530
If we use our measurement model to generate

204
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:33,280
independent samples of yk, it could look something like this:

205
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,240
And ideally, if the measurement model is accurate,

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,150
if we were to collect data from a radar that

207
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,010
is viewing the vehicle like this,

208
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,180
we will get something similar.

209
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,260
However, we should bear in mind that these are just models,

210
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,830
and we will never fully cover all aspects of reality.

211
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,100
What we aim for is to cover the more important aspects that

212
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,380
also affects our filtering results.

213
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,420
There is also a slightly different variant

214
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,390
of our time discrete state space model

215
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,660
where we include a known input signal, uk.

216
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,790
As the signal is assumed to be known,

217
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,330
we treat it as a deterministic variable in our models.

218
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,000
So we simply add it in our equations

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,990
here as a time-varying parameter in our models.

220
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,970
For the density representations, it

221
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,000
is common that we write it like this with a semicolon

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,290
here to indicate that uk is not a stochiastic variable,

223
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,260
but we should rather view it as a time-dependent parameter

224
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,610
in our models.

225
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,010
It is common to use this type of input signal

226
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,000
to include control input signals into our models,

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,300
but it may also be used to include accurate measurements

228
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,860
directly into our models.

229
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,410
For example, if we have an accurate accelerometer

230
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,620
with negligible noise, it would perhaps be a better idea

231
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,380
to include it directly in our process model

232
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,900
through this known input signal, uk,

233
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,990
than it would be to use it as a measurement.

234
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,940
And the reason is that if we use it in our motion model,

235
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,130
we can then hopefully get better predictions here,

236
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,370
which would help us to describe the measurements with less

237
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,660
uncertainty.

238
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,280
Here is a self-assessment question

239
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,330
related to the use of the motion and the measurement model.

240
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,874
