# Sensor Fusion and Non-linear Filtering for Automotive Systems

> ChalmersX: ChM015x

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Basics of Bayesian statistics and recursive estimation theory
Describe and model common sensors, and their measurements
Compare typical motion models used for positioning, in order to know when to use them in practical problems
Describe the essential properties of the Kalman filter (KF) and apply it on linear state space models
Implement key nonlinear filters in Matlab, in order to solve problems with nonlinear motion and/or sensor models
Select a suitable filter method by analysing the properties and requirements in an application
