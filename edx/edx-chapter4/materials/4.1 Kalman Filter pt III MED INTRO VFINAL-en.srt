00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,210
So now we get back to the interpretation and intuition

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,470
of the different components in the Kalman filter.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,440
There is the Kalman gain, the innovation, and its covariance.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,550
A key to be able to do this is to understand this density--

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,230
the density of the predicted measurement given observations

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,830
up to the previous time instance k minus 1, which we can show

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,290
is a Gaussian distribution like this--

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,010
where the mean is Hk, the measurement model matrix,

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,610
times the predicted mean of the state and Sk is its covariance.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,770
It's easy to see that this product here is the mean using

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,480
the observation model.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,050
So the observation model for our linear and Gaussian models

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:54,930
is just yk equals to Hk times xK plus some measurement noise r.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,210
By taking the expected value of this conditioned

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,320
on the previous observations--

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,800
so the expected value of yk conditioned

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,270
on previous measurements--

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,680
if we exchanged yk using this expression here,

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,640
we simply get--

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,300


21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,610
which by definition is simply--

22
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,610
as rk here is 0 mean.

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,310
Now, we see that the conditional expected value is

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,710
by definition precisely this.

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,280
So how can we interpret this?

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,930
Well, we see that the expected value of our observation,

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,130
given our previous observations, are just this Hk times

28
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,160
r, predicted mean of the state.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,910
So this is what we expect the observation to be given all

30
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,360
our previous observation.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,070
We can also show that the covariance of yk here is Sk

32
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,190
So Sk describes our uncertainty in this.

33
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,170
Now, if we look at the innovation,

34
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,120
vk we see that it's equal to the current observation yk

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,410
where we remove what we expect the measurement should be based

36
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,150
on our previous knowledge.

37
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,720
As such, vk captures the new information in yk

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,850
which we were not able to predict

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,440
using our old information.

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,880
And, finally, when we calculate the updated mean like this,

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,150
the Kalman gain is the factor which

42
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,070
will determine how much we should

43
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,880
trust the innovation over our old information

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,590
in the predicted mean.

45
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,770
One can imagine, for example, that if our observations are

46
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,580
very noisy, we would like the Kalman gain to be very small--

47
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,240
close to 0-- such that we do not trust these measurements

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,470
so much.

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,960
So this factor here should be close to 0,

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,050
such our posterior mean is more based on our predicted mean.

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,300
We end with a self-assessment question

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,610
where I would like you to think about what

53
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,980
are reasonable values for the Kalman gain

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,820
in some specific scenarios.

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,306
