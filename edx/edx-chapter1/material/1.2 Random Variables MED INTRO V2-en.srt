00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,610
The theory, methods, and algorithms

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,580
used to do sensor fusion and nonlinear filtering

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,400
relies heavily on mathematical statistics.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,740
In order to follow this course, we therefore

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,840
recommend that you have a good understanding

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,840
of some basic statistical concepts.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,340
To help you out, we have put together this set of lectures

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,250
where we'll go through the most important concepts on a fairly

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,420
high level.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,790
Our hope is that what we present here

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,700
is not new to you, but rather a refresher on things

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,680
that you already know.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,590
However, if you feel that some of these concepts that we

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,350
present here are unfamiliar to you,

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,840
we would highly recommend that you take some time

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,490
and read up on these.

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,530
In this first lecture, we're going

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,630
to discuss random variables.

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,670
When we do nonlinear filtering, we

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,680
need them to describe the quantity

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,150
that we're interested in, for example,

22
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,420
the position of a vehicle.

23
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,020
We also need random variables to describe the observations

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,790
that we want to filter.

25
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,990
To describe our random variables,

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,950
we'd use the so-called probability mass function

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,530
for discrete-valued random variables

28
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,650
and a so-called probability density function

29
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,750
for continuous valued random variables.

30
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,440
Let's start by looking at discrete-valued random

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,440
variables, for which we describe their properties using

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,860
a Probability Mass Function, or pmf for short.

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,860
Now, the probability mass function

34
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,040
of a discrete-valued random variable is, in this course,

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,360
denoted as Pr of z, or just P of z.

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,170
But we will mostly be using this notation in this course.

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,240
Note also that we are using braces here

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,450
to indicate that z is a discrete-valued random

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,320
variable.

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,420
Now, our probability mass function

41
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,490
need to have the following properties in order

42
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,100
to be proper probability mass functions.

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,570
First, the probability that our discrete-valued random variable

44
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,000
z is equal to some integral value

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,220
i, which is written like this, needs

46
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,710
to be greater than or equal to 0.

47
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,480
Now, one way to view this value here

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,630
is if we collect many values of z,

49
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,240
the fraction of these that are equal to i

50
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,070
is given by this number here.

51
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,740
And this needs to hold for all values of i.

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,860
The second property of our probability mass function

53
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,980
is that if we sum over all values of z,

54
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,780
this sum needs to be 1.

55
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,580
That is, the probability that z takes any value needs to be 1.

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,970
We can also note that as a consequence of these two,

57
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,750
we cannot have a probability mass for a value i that is

58
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,130
greater than 1, which seems to be reasonable, right?

59
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,410
Now if we look at this use in the example of a fair dice,

60
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,940
the probability mass function for the face value

61
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,040
that I would get if we rolled the dice can

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,880
be written like this.

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,530
So the dice has six faces with a value 1

64
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,850
through 6, which each is equally probable.

65
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,210
So the probability that z is i is equal to 1/6,

66
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,410
if i is equal to 1, 2, and so on up to 6, and 0 otherwise.

67
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,650
If we visualize this pmf, it will look something

68
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,320
like this, where we only have probability

69
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
mass for discrete values.

70
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:28,290


71
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,230
I would encourage you to verify for yourself

72
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,430
that this is a pmf here which has both of these properties

73
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,680
here, and that you understand why that is.

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,920
Now let's look at a corresponding description

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,620
for continuous-valued random variables, which

76
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,880
we call the Probability Density Function, or pdf for short.

77
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,220
So the probability density function

78
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,650
of a continuous-valued random variable

79
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,740
is denoted as lowercase p of z.

80
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,040
And again, the probability density of any value of z

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,580
needs to be greater or equal to 0.

82
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,600
And if we integrate p of z over all values of z,

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,560
this integral needs to be 1.

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,250
Now again, the interpretation of this

85
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,029
is that the probability that z takes some value always

86
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,079
needs to be 1.

87
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,010
However, it does not follow that p of z has to be lower than 1

88
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,640
for all values of z, as in the discrete case.

89
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,760
We only require that it should integrate to 1.

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
So the probability density for some value of z

91
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,830
could actually be greater than 1.

92
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,550
Let's look at an example of a continuous-valued random

93
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,080
variable z which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2 pi.

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,710
So here z could, for example, be a stochastic angle.

95
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,220
The pdf of z can then be written like this,

96
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,810
where we have 1 over 2 pi if z is within the interval of 0

97
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,240
to 2 pi and 0 otherwise.

98
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,620
Now, we get 1 over 2 pi here, as all angles are equally

99
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,200
probable in a uniform distribution

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,470
and the size of the interval is 2 pi.

101
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,300
So 1 over 2 pi.

102
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,190
If we visualize this density, it will look something like this.

103
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:21,010


104
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,010
If we were to relate the probability mass

105
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,100
function to the probability density function,

106
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,010
we can consider the discrete-valued random variable

107
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,560
describing the event that z is in some interval A.

108
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,936
So we have some interval here which we call A.

109
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:40,200
And we want to know if z is within this interval.

110
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,070
Now, the probability mass that z is in this interval

111
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,390
can be written like this.

112
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:58,560
So z is in A and can be calculated by integrating pdf

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,010
over the interval A. So this is the integral of the pdf.

114
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,690


115
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,230
So in this case, the pmf is the integral of the pdf.

116
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:22,594
