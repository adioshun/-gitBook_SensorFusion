00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,550
So now we have seen some examples of methods

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,930
that you will learn in this course.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,860
Let's go into a bit more detail about what you will actually

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,950
learn and how the course is structured.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,040
So the course is divided into seven sections.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,650
In this first section that you're watching right now,

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,660
we will give you a course introduction

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,940
and a primer in statistics.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,120
We will use mathematical statistics extensively

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,510
throughout this course, and we, therefore, offer this refresher

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,020
in some of the more important concepts that you will need.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,500
However, we hope that these concepts are not new to you.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,710
The second section will focus on the specific statistical

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,890
framework that all our filters are based on,

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,930
and that is Bayesian statistics.

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,580
You will learn the basic concepts

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,010
of Bayesian statistics, which includes

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,420
the most important rule of them all, which is Bayes' rule.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,670
You will also learn about the common building blocks

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,980
that makes up a Bayesian model and how

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,000
to make optimal decisions using this Bayesian framework.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
When you've completed this section,

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,590
you will be able to explain the fundamental principles

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,360
in Bayesian estimation.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,230
In the third section, we will introduce state space models

26
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,400
and show how we can design optimal filters based on these.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,800
And after this section, you will understand

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,840
the fundamental assumptions that are made

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,330
and be able to derive expressions

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,930
for an optimal filter based on these assumptions.

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,050
Now it's finally time that we learn our first filter,

32
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,050
and that is the Kalman filter.

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,700
Some of you might have come across this filter before

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,350
in previous courses.

35
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,030
In this course, we will, however,

36
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,400
start from scratch with a focus that you

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,100
should be able to describe the essential properties

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,440
of the Kalman filter and be able to apply it

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,690
on linear state space models.

40
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,360
As we alluded in our example in the beginning,

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,260
our state space models consist of two basic models, one motion

42
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,690
model and one measurement model.

43
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,260
In this section, we will present the most commonly used motion

44
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,330
and measurement models for automotive applications

45
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,900
and show how we can derive time discrete motion

46
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,600
models from time continuous dynamic models.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,740
After this section, you'll be able to summarize and compare

48
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,830
the most typical motion models in automotive systems

49
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,910
in order to know when to use them in practical problems.

50
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,640
You will also be able to describe and model commonly

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,160
used sensor measurements.

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,220
Now in section four, you learned about the Kalman filter,

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,120
which we can use if our state space models are linear.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,400
If we have nonlinear models, however, we

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,060
need to do something else.

56
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,020
So in this section, we will look at an important family

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,970
of nonlinear filters, and that is

58
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,140
the nonlinear Gaussian filters.

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,740
Here, you will get to implement the key nonlinear

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,490
Gaussian filters, both the extended Kalman filter, as well

61
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,650
as the unscented Kalman filter.

62
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,700
You will also analyze how they behave in different scenarios.

63
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Lastly, we will present the particle filters,

64
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,590
which is also a nonlinear filter but,

65
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,870
in contrast to all the previous methods,

66
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,780
the particle filter do not try to describe the results using

67
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,880
a Gaussian distribution, but rather

68
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,910
as a set of weighted particles as we saw in the self

69
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,380
localization problem.

70
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,450
You will get to implement also these filters

71
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,390
and try them out on illustrative examples.

72
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,310
After completing all these sections,

73
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,000
you will be able to solve a variety of important real world

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,570
filtering problems by employing and adapting the methods

75
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,180
that you have learned to a variety of applications.

76
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,000
So once again, welcome to this course.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,440
I hope you will enjoy it.

78
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,147
