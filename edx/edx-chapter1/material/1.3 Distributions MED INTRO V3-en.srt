1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,460
In this course, we're very interested in how

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,280
the distribution of two or more random variables

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,360
depend on each other.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,030
We do this by mainly considering the so-called conditional

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,750
and joint distributions.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,330
Additionally, we are also interested in knowing

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,210
the so-called marginal distribution, which

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,780
is the isolated distribution of a single random variable, where

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,990
we have removed the influence of all the other variables.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,690
All of these are central in their understanding

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,060
of our nonlinear filtering methods.

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,450
In this lecture, we will define these distributions

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,940
and look at how they are related to each other.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,160
We will also look at an illustrative toy

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,670
example, including all of these distributions.

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,680
We start by looking at conditional distributions,

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,210
which are indispensable components in sensor fusion,

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,090
filtering, and Bayesian estimation, in general.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,070
And we define them like this--

20
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,930
let x and z be two random variables, with the joint pdf p

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,110
of x comma z, so p of x and z.

22
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,830
Now the conditional density function,

23
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,400
which you read as the probability density of z

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,600
given x is defined through the so-called product rule, which

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,260
states that the joint probability of x and z

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,660
can be written as a product of these two densities--

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,300
so the conditional density of z given

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,440
x times the marginal distribution of x.

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,540
This implies that for possible values

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,280
of x, that is, values of x which has non-zero probability

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,460
density, we can write the conditional density of z

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,190
given x as the ratio between the joint probability of x and z

33
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,130
divided by the marginal of x.

34
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,580
So we normalize the joint distribution of x and z

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,420
with a probability of x to get the conditional density of z

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,350
given x.

37
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,340
Now, typically, we view this here as a function of z,

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,760
and that x is just some known constant value.

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,890
In our case, this is usually the value of some measurement

40
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,650
that we have already observed.

41
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,780
To make this a bit more obvious, we

42
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,740
could rewrite this expression as p of z

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,500
where x is equal to some x prime--

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,780
so x prime is just some constant value.

45
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:27,610
Then we get p of x prime and z divided by p of x prime.

46
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,810
Now, as x prime is just some constant, then p

47
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,720
of x prime is also some constant.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,470
And p of x prime comma z now only

49
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,910
depend really on z, as x is some constant.

50
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,950
So we can view this as a parameter in this function

51
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,040
here.

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,670
So, in principle, we take a joint probability density

53
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,140
of p of x prime and z, and then normalize it

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,540
with this constant of the probability density of x prime.

55
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,520
Now, as we're typically interested in this

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,030
as a function of z, in many cases, it's beneficial for us

57
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,390
to view this as proportional to the joint density.

58
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,790


59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,940
So the conclusion here is that the conditional density of z

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,500
given x is proportional to the joint density where we have

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,160
fixed one of the dimensions-- x, in this case--

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,960
and then view it as a function of z.

63
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,810
And the interpretation here is that p of z

64
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,950
given x describes the distribution of z given

65
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,510
that x is known.

66
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,870
So we don't have any uncertainty about x anymore-- x

67
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,000
is equal to x prime, in this case.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,050
We know this.

69
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,210
Let's look at the toy example to hopefully make

70
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,710
things a bit more clear.

71
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,110
In this toy example, Sara decides every day

72
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,590
how many pieces of candy she can have for an after-lunch snack.

73
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,800
Now to make things a bit more interesting,

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,840
she decides how many candies she gets

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,350
at random using the intricate scheme involving both tossing

76
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,450
a coin and rolling dice.

77
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,200
So with 40% probability, she tosses a coin

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,770
where if it end up at heads, means that she

79
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,360
will get 1 piece of candy.

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,190
And if it gets tails, it means that she

81
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,260
will get 0 pieces of candy.

82
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,930
However, with 60% probability, she

83
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,230
throws a dice, and whatever the number on the dice is,

84
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,500
that will be how many candies she will get that day.

85
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,050
Now, if we let z denote the number of candies

86
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,290
that she eats, what is, then, the conditional probability

87
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,820
that she eats i candies, given that Sara tosses a coin

88
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,060
or that she throws a dice.

89
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,720
Well, let's look at the conditional probability here.

90
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,710
So we condition on that Sara tosses a coin,

91
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,480
so we have no uncertainty regarding which method

92
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,960
that she uses to determine how many candies that she gets.

93
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,120
Now if we know that she tosses a coin,

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,910
we also know that with 50% probability,

95
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,720
she will get one piece of candy, and with 50% probability,

96
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,550
she will get zero pieces of candy.

97
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,620
With this information, we can describe

98
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,390
this conditional density--

99
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,090
or conditional probability-- like this.

100
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,770
We'll have 0.5 probability that she will get 1 or 0 candies.

101
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,580


102
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,220
And then 0% probability that she will get

103
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,670
any other number of candies.

104
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,860


105
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,980
Similarly, if we know that she throws a dice,

106
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,900
the only uncertainty that we have left

107
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,690
is regarding the face value of the dice.

108
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,450
If she rolls a 1, she gets 1 candy.

109
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,180
If she rolls a 2, she gets 2 pieces, and so on.

110
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,270
And as she has a fair dice, she has equal probability

111
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,530
of getting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 pieces of candy.

112
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,730
And the probability of this is 1 over 6.

113
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,980
We can just express this conditional probability

114
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,430
like this.

115
00:05:52,430 --> 00:06:02,450
So 1 over 6 probability, if i is equal to 1, 2, and so forth, up

116
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,312
to 6, and 0 probability otherwise.

117
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:16,180


118
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,650
The next thing that we will look at

119
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,050
is marginal distributions, which we

120
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,650
get by using the law of total probability.

121
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,170
Now there are many important results

122
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,330
in nonlinear filtering that is obtained

123
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,490
from the law of total probability.

124
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,110
So I highly recommend that you get

125
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,760
yourself familiarized with it.

126
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,720
Now the law of total probability order sum rule

127
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,350
is defined like this.

128
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,520
Let's say that we, again, have two random variables-- so x

129
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,490
and z-- which has some joint distribution, like this

130
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,550
in the discrete case, or like this in the continuous case.

131
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,990
So if x takes values in sum set, Sx, the law

132
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,030
of total probability states that the marginal distribution of z,

133
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,479
which we write like this in the discrete case,

134
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,020
and like this in the continuous case,

135
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,630
can be found from the joint distribution

136
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,230
by summing over all the possible values of x

137
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,000
in the discrete case, or integrating

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
over all the possible values of x in the continuous case.

139
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,860
We can interpret this as we are marginalizing out

140
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,570
the influence of x by summing or integrating

141
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,080
over all possible values of x.

142
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,380
So what is left is the marginal probability distribution

143
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,470
that now only depends on z, in this case.

144
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,520
So we're marginalizing out x from these joint distributions.

145
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,590
Now there's also a common and equivalent way

146
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,860
of expressing the law of total probability, and that,

147
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,310
by splitting these joint probabilities using the product

148
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,730
rule into these two factors, like this.

149
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,540
So these two are equivalent forms of the same law.

150
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,610
So let's return to the candy example

151
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,640
and try to find a marginal distribution of how

152
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,580
many candies that Sara gets, without caring

153
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,820
about how she actually got him.

154
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,260
So to calculate these marginal pmf how many candies Sara gets,

155
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,810
we used the law of total probability

156
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,190
to sum over all possible ways that Sara chooses

157
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,580
how many candies that she gets, either by tossing a coin

158
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,070
or throwing a dice, and then summing

159
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,770
over this joint distribution of z and x.

160
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,660
Note that this is just a joint distribution of z and x.

161
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,940


162
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,799
Additionally, remember that she tosses

163
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,090
a coin with 40% probability, and that she throws

164
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,140
a dice with 60% probability.

165
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,780
Now I would encourage you to post a video here and try

166
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,960
to calculate this marginal distribution on your own.

167
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,880
As a hint, I would suggest that you first

168
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,310
calculate the joint probability of z

169
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,280
and x by filling out this table here,

170
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,792
and using this expression here for the joint probability.

171
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,250
Additional things that I would like

172
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,170
for you to consider while doing this

173
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,380
is, how can we go from the joint distribution

174
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,290
to the marginal distribution by using this table here?

175
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,590
And can we also find the conditional distributions

176
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,640
in this table?

177
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,890
If you pause now and try to answer these questions

178
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,410
on your own, I will go through the answers with you

179
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,240
when you get back.

180
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,240


181
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,400
So now I hope that you've been able to solve this.

182
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,030
Now what I would do is that I would start by calculating

183
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,780
this joint probability here.

184
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,910
And we know that we can express this joint probability using

185
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,620
the product through like this.

186
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,860
So if we look at this cell here, we

187
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,680
have the probability that she tosses a coin

188
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,840
and gets 0 pieces of candy.

189
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,130
Now the probability of getting no candies, if we condition on

190
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,510
that she tosses a coin is 0.5.

191
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,640
And the probability that she tosses a coin

192
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,600
from the first place is 40%, or 0.4.

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,270
So here we have 0.5 times 0.4, which is 0.2.

194
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,550
Now the probability that she tosses a coin

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:14,730
and gets 1 piece of candy is the same, so we also have 0.2 here.

196
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,920
However, she cannot get more than 1 piece of candy if she

197
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,420
tosses a coin, so all of these probabilities here are 0.

198
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,870
Similarly, if we look at the probability of throwing a dice

199
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,750
and getting a certain number of candies,

200
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,550
she has equal probability of getting 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,

201
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,630
or 6 pieces of candy, which is 1 over 6

202
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,600
for this conditional probability here, where we condition on

203
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,640
that she is throwing a dice.

204
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,840
And the probability of throwing a dice is 0.6.

205
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,110
So all of these values here are 1 over 6 times

206
00:10:51,110 --> 00:11:00,850
0.6, which is 0.1.

207
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,000
And there is 0 probability of throwing the dice

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,280
and getting 0 pieces of candies--

209
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,150
that should be 0 here.

210
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,780
So how do we go from the joint probability

211
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,250
here to the marginal probability of z?

212
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,450
Well, our aim is to get the probability of just z,

213
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,770
and by using the law of total probability,

214
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,240
we sum out the dependency on x by fixing z and summing

215
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,280
over all possible values of x.

216
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,900
And if we look at this table here,

217
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,750
we do this by looking at one of the columns

218
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,330
here and then summing over the rows.

219
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:40,470
So we get the marginal probability of z

220
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,080
by summing over the rows for each column.

221
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,390


222
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,400
And while we're at it, we might as well

223
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,210
verify that this holds true for the marginal distribution of p

224
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:03,660
of x, which we get for each row by summing over the columns,

225
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,710
instead, in this table.

226
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,430


227
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,940
Now we see we get 0.4 for tossing

228
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,890
a coin, which seems reasonable.

229
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,370
And we get 0.6 for throwing the dice, which

230
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,070
also seems reasonable.

231
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,219
This is what we expected from the beginning.

232
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,760
Now we're also promised that we could

233
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,230
find these conditional distributions in this table

234
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,850
here.

235
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,390
So this conditional distribution here-- the distribution

236
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,760
of pieces of candy that Sara gets,

237
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,760
given that we condition on the method that Sara uses.

238
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,650
And, as I mentioned before, we typically

239
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,500
view this as a function of z for a fixed value

240
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,870
on x, which is known.

241
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,500
Now if we look at this table here, for a fixed value of x,

242
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,960
let's say that Sara tosses a coin,

243
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,500
we can see that this row here is proportional

244
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,010
to the marginal distribution of pieces of candy that Sara gets,

245
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,920
given that she tosses a coin.

246
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:08,970


247
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,375
And we can also see that the proportionality constant

248
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,070
that we need to divide by in order for this

249
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,770
to be a proper density is 0.4, which is the probability

250
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,170
that Sara tosses a coin.

251
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,800
Similarly, this row here is then the conditional probability

252
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,770
of z given that Sara throws a dice.

253
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,810


254
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,270
And, again, the proportionality of the constant

255
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,400
we get by summing over all of these

256
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,670
is 0.6, which is the marginal distribution

257
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,750
that Sara throws a dice.

258
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,660
Now we can also get the marginal distribution

259
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,560
of x given that she gets a certain piece of candy,

260
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,740
which we then find on the columns here.

261
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:03,070
So this, for example, is then proportional to the probability

262
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:09,960
of x, given that she gets 5 pieces of candy.

263
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:19,625
