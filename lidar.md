The information is stored as spherical coordinates (r, φ, θ), 
- r : radial distance
- φ : polar angle 
- θ : azimuth angle

The data is converted so that zero azimuth points in the positive x direction with positive rotation counter clockwise (in the xy-plane) and with polar angle relative the z-axis.
